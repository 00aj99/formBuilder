formBuilder
===========

A jQuery plugin for drag and drop form creation

## This is a Work In Progress
While most features of this plugin work, an output parse still needs to be added so you can use this for your project. Currently all field data is saved to and from a textarea that acts as a scratch pad and field data is saved in an XML format. The end product will be a jQuery plugin that lets users create forms using a drag and drop editor with data that is saved as JSON.
